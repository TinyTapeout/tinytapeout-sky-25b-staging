  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_top_general"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.

# The pinout of your project. Leave unused pins blank. DO NOT delete or add any pins.
# This section is for the datasheet/website. Use descriptive names (e.g., RX, TX, MOSI, SCL, SEG_A, etc.).
