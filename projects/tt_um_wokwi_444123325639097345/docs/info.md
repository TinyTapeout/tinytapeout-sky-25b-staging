## How it works

inputs 0 and 1 are connected to the first and gate going to output 0. inputs 2 and 3 are connected to the second and gate going to output 1. inputs 4 and 5 are connected to the first nand gate going to output 2. inputs 6 and 7 are connected to the second nand gate going to output 3. 

## How to test

| Input A | Input B | AND Output | NAND Output |
| :-----: | :-----: | :--------: | :---------: |
|    0    |    0    |      0     |      1      |
|    0    |    1    |      0     |      1      |
|    1    |    0    |      0     |      1      |
|    1    |    1    |      1     |      0      |
