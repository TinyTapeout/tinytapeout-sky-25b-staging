## How it works

2 4 bit registers fed into a full adder and a full subtractor, the output is chosen via mux

## How to test

in input 0-3 give the data in binary, swich registers with input 4, choose the output with input 7

## External hardware

none required, however to see the output leds are quite nice, to choose the input switches are also a qol feature
