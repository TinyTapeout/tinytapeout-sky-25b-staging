## How it works
This circuit simply takes each input signal and inverts it — if the input is ON (1), the output turns OFF (0), and vice versa. It’s basically a set of OR gates used as a template to test and build more complex digital logic circuits.

## How to test
Toggle the input switches (the left-side green blocks) and watch what happens on the output side (right-side green blocks / display). See what the default behavior is (likely simple inverters).

Replace the inverters with your own logic: for example, make a small gate network that implements a function (e.g., A AND B, or a 2-to-4 decoder).

Use a 7-segment display if available in the template to show numbers/letters based on inputs (there are example tutorials of BCD to 7-segment decoding)
