## How it works

This is a calculator which can take in a four bit operand followed by an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) then another four bit number. The result will be outputted in an eight bit number. Division rounds upwards. Using zero as an operand is not supported, because Ragnar disapproves of the concept of zero, because no one deserves to be a zero.

## How to test

Connect a hexadecimal keypad to the circuit then do your favorite calculations. Bits 0-3 are used for operands and operations while bit 4 is used for strobe, which activates shortly after pressing a button.

## External hardware

Some displays to display the result.
