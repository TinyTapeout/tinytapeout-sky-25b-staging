project:
  title:        "8-Bit ALU"      # Project title
  author:       "Timon Strassern"      # Your name
  description:  "8-Bit arithmetic logic unit perfomring arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers."     # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     40000000       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
