  description:  "Binary counter that runs on internal 1Hz clock and outputs high logic on each of the outputs to light LEDS to show a binary representation of a counter.  Note that upon boot, the lights might already be in some sequence as I could not figure out to issue a reset on the D Flipflops"      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Wokwi" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     1       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2
