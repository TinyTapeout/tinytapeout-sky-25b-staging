## How it works

Turn a switch on to add to the total, which would then be displayed on the 7-segment display. Sums can only have a total of one digit; for example, switching 0 and 7 on will output 9, while switching 1 and 7 on will output nothing because it makes 10, which is not a single-digit sum.

## How to test

Set the inputs to add to a number from 0-9 and check if the output shows the correct number.

## External hardware

Requires a single 7-segment display.
