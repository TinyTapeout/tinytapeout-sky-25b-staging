## How it works

A fun little game, 4 players (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) around a table, each with an arcade button, must challenge each other by pressing their button as fast as possible.


## How to test

Pressing the button causes their led to progress to the center circle. The first to reach the center wins.

## External hardware

I'm putting here the material I used for the project, but of course if it's compatible this list can be adapted.

- 4 x **Arcade buttons** (https://www.amazon.fr/EG-STARTS-Nouveau-Boutons-poussoirs-lumineux/dp/B01MSNXLN0/)
- 1 x **LEDs Circles (with WS2812B Leds)** (https://www.amazon.fr/Treedix-anneaux-WS2812B-adressable-Raspberry/dp/B0CD3DYJRK/)

Should be connected to the FPGA inputs with a pull down resistor
