## How it works
1-bit full adder has three inputs, A, B, Cin, and two outputs, Sum, and Cout. Give the inputs from switches and observe the corresponding outputs at the LEDs. If A is 0, and B is 1, then sum goes to 1, and sum LED is turned on. If A, B, Cin are high, then both Sum, and Cout LEDs are turned on.

## How to test

Give the inputs from switches and observe the corresponding output from the LEDs at the output.,

## External hardware
USE Swtiches and LEDS at the input, and LEDs at the output.
